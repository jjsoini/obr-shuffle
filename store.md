# Shuffle

Image shuffler.
Select images (ie. cards) and click 'Shuffle' in the context menu. This will shuffle the z-index of the selected images and center them all in the same location and reset their rotation. As long as the images are on the same layer, their order is now randomized. To hide the top card you can use a small fog area that covers the face of the shuffled cards, or use the Intangible Images extension to create a 'back' card and place it on a layer that's above the face cards.
